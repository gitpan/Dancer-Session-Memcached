NAME
    Dancer::Session::Memcached - Memcached-based session backend for Dancer

VERSION
    version 0.202

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a session engine based on the Memcache API.
    Session are stored as memcache objects via a list of Memcached servers.

CONFIGURATION
    The setting session should be set to "memcached" in order to use this
    session engine in a Dancer application.

    A mandatory setting is needed as well: "memcached_servers", which should
    contain a comma-separated list of reachable memecached servers (can be
    either address:port or sockets).

    Here is an example configuration that uses this session engine

        session: "memcached"
        memcached_servers: "10.0.1.31:11211,10.0.1.32:11211,10.0.1.33:11211,/var/sock/memcached"

DEPENDENCY
    This module depends on Cache::Memcached.

SEE ALSO
    See Dancer::Session for details about session usage in route handlers.
